# VenueCharm — Session Progress

_Last updated: 2026-07-02 (session 18)_

---

## ✅ Fully Working

### Infrastructure
- Next.js 14 App Router with TypeScript strict mode — `npx tsc --noEmit` is clean
- Supabase auth (email/password + Google OAuth), middleware route protection
- Cloudinary image upload for venue photos (`/api/upload-venue-photos`)
- shadcn/ui design system (22 Radix components), Tailwind RTL, Hebrew/English locale switcher
- Cookie-based locale persistence (Hebrew default, `venuecharm-locale` cookie)

### Auth Flow
- Register → role selection (visual Renter/Host cards) → verify email → login
- **Google OAuth with role selection** — `RegisterForm` (Client Component) holds `role` state; both email and Google paths read from it; role stored in short-lived `venuecharm-pending-role` cookie through the redirect; callback upserts into `public.users` with `ignoreDuplicates: true`
- `POST /api/auth/signout` route handler — fixes 404 on sign-out
- **Redesigned profile page** (session 10) — 3-card layout: identity with Cloudinary **avatar upload**, inline name/phone edit, and account & security (**change email** with Supabase re-verification, **change password**). Backed by `src/actions/profile.ts`.
- **Post-login redirect** (session 10) — middleware/login/OAuth callback carry a safe `?redirect=` target (`isSafeRedirectPath` guard); default `/` not `/dashboard`. Renters no longer bounce to `/profile`.
- Middleware protects: `/dashboard`, `/listings`, `/host/*`, `/profile`, `/bookings`, `/admin`, `/messages`, `/favorites`, `/rfp`

### Host Side
- `(host)/layout.tsx` — role guard (non-HOST → redirect to `/profile`)
- `/dashboard` — 4 KPI cards (active listings, pending requests, upcoming bookings, **real revenue from CONFIRMED+COMPLETED bookings**) + recent activity feed + Stripe Connect onboarding banner when not onboarded
- `/listings` — table of all host venues with status badges, edit links, soft-delete (confirm dialog)
- `/listings/new` — redesigned venue creation form: Google Maps picker with **Places Autocomplete search box** (address/city auto-filled by pin drop or search, lat/lng hidden), scroll-to-zoom via `gestureHandling: 'greedy'`, **AmenitiesPicker** (24 toggle buttons in 5 categories: Core, AV & Events, Food & Drink, Outdoor & Spaces, Facilities), **WeekdayPicker** for default availability (pre-populates `availability` table for next 90 days), cancellation policy picker, Cloudinary photo upload
- `/listings/[id]/edit` — prefilled edit form with AmenitiesPicker (pre-selected), existing photo management, cancellation policy; lat/lng visible inputs removed; **HostAvailabilityEditor** — 2-month calendar where hosts can click to block/unblock dates; booked dates (PENDING/CONFIRMED) are read-only disabled
- `/host/bookings` — Pending / Upcoming / Past tabs with booking count badge
- `/host/bookings/[id]` — full booking detail (renter info, dates, price breakdown) with Accept/Decline buttons; Accept gated behind `stripe_charges_enabled` check
- `/host/calendar` — 2-month availability calendar with click-to-toggle (blocked=rose, booked=violet)
- `/host/payouts` — 3-state Stripe Connect UI: not started / in progress / complete; payout history list
- Server actions: `createVenue` (saves amenities + seeds 90-day availability), `updateVenue` (saves amenities + **calls `update_venue_location` RPC to update PostGIS geography**), `deleteVenue`, `acceptBooking`, `declineBooking`, `cancelOwnBooking`, `setAvailability`
- `src/actions/reviews.ts` — `submitReview` (auth check, booking ownership verify, allows COMPLETED or CONFIRMED+past, handles duplicate 23505 error)

### Stripe Connect (Host Onboarding)
- `src/lib/stripe-connect.ts` — `createConnectAccount()`, `createOnboardingLink()`, `fetchConnectStatus()`, `splitChargeAmount()`
- `src/actions/stripe-connect.ts` — `startStripeOnboarding()`, `refreshStripeStatus()`
- `POST /api/stripe/connect/onboard` — initiates Connect Express onboarding, returns redirect URL
- `GET /api/stripe/connect/return` — Stripe return URL; syncs DB then redirects to `/host/payouts`
- `GET /api/stripe/connect/refresh` — Stripe refresh URL (expired link); generates new link
- `ConnectOnboardingCard` — Client Component with `useTransition` + toast; redirects to Stripe's hosted flow
- Webhook `account.updated` handler — auto-syncs `stripe_charges_enabled` when Stripe confirms onboarding

### Payments (Destination Charges + Refunds)
- PaymentIntent created with `transfer_data.destination` (host's Connect account) + `application_fee_amount` (15%)
- On host accept → `paymentIntents.capture()` → Stripe auto-transfers 85% to host
- Webhook `transfer.created` → stores `stripe_transfer_id` on payment row
- Webhook `charge.refunded` → syncs `refund_amount` on payment row
- `cancelOwnBooking` PENDING path → cancels held PI (no capture, no refund needed)
- `cancelOwnBooking` CONFIRMED path → `stripe.refunds.create()` with `reverse_transfer: true` + `refund_application_fee: true` **only when `stripe_transfer_id` exists** (safe for pre-Connect bookings)

### Cancellation Policies
- `src/lib/cancellation.ts` — pure `computeDeadline()` + `refundPercent()` helpers
- 3 tiers: FLEXIBLE (24h / 100%|0%), MODERATE (7d/24h / 100%|50%|0%), STRICT (7d / 50%|0%)
- `cancellation_deadline` stored on booking row at creation time
- Refund preview shown on renter booking detail page (`/bookings/[id]`) — "If you cancel now: ₪X"
- `CancellationPolicyPicker` component in venue creation/edit forms
- Policy displayed on venue detail page so renters see it before booking

### Admin Panel
- `(admin)/layout.tsx` — ADMIN role guard + `AdminSubNav` with Queue ↔ Dev Tools tab links
- `/admin` — tabbed table: PENDING_APPROVAL / ACTIVE / SUSPENDED venues (uses `createAdminClient()` so all statuses are visible)
- `/admin/[id]` — read-only venue detail page for review (uses `createAdminClient()`)
- `AdminActionButtons` — approve (→ ACTIVE) / suspend (→ SUSPENDED) using `createAdminClient()` to bypass RLS
- `/admin/dev` — **Dev Tools page** with 4 tabs:
  - **Stats** — Users (total + by role), Venues (total + by status), Bookings (total + by status), Revenue (confirmed + completed)
  - **Users** — all users table with per-row role dropdown (RENTER/HOST/ADMIN) + verify/unverify toggle button, Stripe status badge
  - **Bookings** — all bookings with venue, renter, dates, amount, status; Cancel button for PENDING/CONFIRMED rows
  - **Tools** — Seed Data (create 5 test venues in Israeli cities + 3 test users) + Danger Zone (reset to pending, cancel all pending, delete [TEST] venues, delete all bookings — all behind Dialog confirmations)
- `src/actions/admin.ts` — all dev-tools server actions, guarded by `requireAdmin()`

### Renter Side
- `/` — homepage with hero, highlights, featured venues grid (up to 8 from DB) with **avg rating + review count** per card, CTA
- `/venues` — **Airbnb-style split-view search**: venue list + sticky map (40% width desktop), pagination
  - **MapView** — `AdvancedMarkerElement` price bubble markers (₪X/hr white pill → purple on select, light purple on card hover), InfoWindow popup card (photo, title, city, capacity, **avg rating + review count**, price, link to detail), "Search as I move the map" checkbox (fetches `/api/venues/search` on map `idle` event), `searchKey` prevents fitBounds on pan-only updates, scroll-to-zoom via `gestureHandling: 'greedy'`
  - **SearchBarAutocomplete** — Airbnb-style 3-field pill (Where / When / Add guests) embedded in the navbar second row (only visible on `/venues`); Google Places dropdown; pushes `?lat=&lng=&radius=30&q=` to URL; syncs state from URL params when navigating
  - **FilterDialogButton** — modal-based filter trigger (sort, price, amenities) with active-count badge; `clearAll` resets filter params; shows result count in confirm button
  - **VenuePagination** — URL-based pagination (`?page=N`), `buildPages()` with `…` gap markers, hidden when in map-drag search mode
  - **Mobile**: floating "Show map / Show list" pill toggle, map goes fullscreen on mobile
  - `SearchResults` tracks `liveVenues`, `hoveredId`, `isMapSearch` state — updates from URL or bounds search; card hover passes `hoveredId` to MapView; pagination shown only for URL-driven results
  - Default view (no query, no coords): Israel center (31.5, 34.85) with 500 km radius via PostGIS RPC
  - **Pagination**: 14 venues per page, server-side slice; ratings fetched only for visible page; `<Image priority>` for first 4 cards
  - **Grid**: 2 columns (sm:grid-cols-2), removed xl:grid-cols-3
  - **Venue cards open in a new tab** (`target="_blank"`)
  - FilterPanel (sort, price slider, amenity checkboxes)
- `/venues/[id]` — full detail page: VenuePhotoGallery (lightbox), VenueAmenityList (icon chips), AvailabilityCalendar (read-only), BookingWidget (sticky sidebar), **cancellation policy display**, **ReviewList** (reviewer avatar+initials, name, stars, date, comment with newline preservation)
- `/venues/[id]/book` — BookingForm with Hourly/Full Day tabs, live PriceBreakdown (subtotal + 15% fee)
- `/venues/[id]/checkout` — order summary + Stripe Elements (or placeholder if Stripe not configured)
- `/venues/[id]/booking-confirmed` — success page (Stripe return URL)
- `/bookings` — renter's own bookings: Pending / Upcoming / Past tabs
- `/bookings/[id]` — booking detail with venue card, **date+time display** (`formatDateTimeLocalized`), price, status; refund preview; cancel button gated by `isOver` (hides for past events); **ReviewForm** (1–5 stars + comment) shown on COMPLETED bookings or CONFIRMED+past; "already reviewed" message if duplicate

### Marketing
- `/how-it-works` — 3-step explainer
- `/pricing` — commission model (15% renter, 0% host listing fee)

### Navbar (PublicNavbar)
- **Redesigned (session 10)**: single **"Log in"** button (merged the old Sign in + Join), full-width header (no max-w cap). `ThemeToggle` switches light/dark on click (no dropdown). "Become a host" calls the `becomeHost()` action (RENTER→HOST upgrade then `/listings/new`).
- Hamburger menu holds: role-specific links (Admin panel / Host dashboard / My bookings / Smart matching) + favourites + profile + **footer pages (Find venues, How it works, Pricing)** + a **language toggle** + Sign out; logged-out shows Log in / Become a host + the same explore links and language toggle.
- Second row on `/venues` only: `SearchRow` (SearchBarAutocomplete + FilterDialogButton) wrapped in `<Suspense>` with animated skeleton fallback to prevent layout shift during hydration

### Logo & Brand Assets
- `src/components/ui/LogoIcon.tsx` — `LogoFull` component: inline SVG of the full horizontal lockup (icon mark + "VenueCharm" wordmark as vector paths) traced from `logo/logo-name-horizantal.svg`; purple gradient `#3b0764 → #7e22ce → #a855f7`; `viewBox="135 178 740 200"`; `h-11 w-auto` in navbar/auth/footer, `h-10 w-auto` in host sidebar
- Used in all four layout files: `PublicNavbar`, `AuthShell`, `Footer`, `HostSidebar` — replacing the previous placeholder `MapPin` icon
- `src/app/icon.png` (256×256) — Next.js App Router auto-detects as favicon
- `src/app/apple-icon.png` (180×180, white bg) — auto-detects as Apple touch icon
- `src/app/opengraph-image.png` (1200×630) — OG share image
- `src/app/twitter-image.png` (1200×630) — Twitter card image

### Global
- `not-found.tsx`, `error.tsx`, `loading.tsx` boundaries
- `<Toaster />` (sonner) in root layout — toast notifications throughout
- 50 seeded venues with amenities (WiFi, Parking, AV, etc.) populated via SQL update

---

### Email Notifications (Resend) · [#37](https://github.com/Abdalrahman-Muhtaseb/venuecharm/issues/37)
- `src/lib/email.ts` — Resend client with `isResendConfigured()` guard, bilingual (he/en) HTML templates, RTL-aware, purple gradient branding matching the logo, `icon.png` embedded in header
- `getEmailLocale()` reads `venuecharm-locale` cookie so emails match the user's selected language
- Fire-and-forget pattern — email failures never block the booking flow
- 5 lifecycle emails: booking requested (→ renter + → host in parallel), booking accepted, booking declined, booking cancelled (→ host)
- Wired into `src/actions/bookings.ts` — `requestBooking`, `acceptBooking`, `declineBooking`, `cancelOwnBooking`
- Test mode limitation: Resend only delivers to the account owner email until a sending domain is verified

### Production Deployment · [#54](https://github.com/Abdalrahman-Muhtaseb/venuecharm/issues/54)
- Live at **https://venuecharm.vercel.app**
- All env vars set in Vercel dashboard; `RESEND_API_KEY` synced via Resend × Vercel integration
- `metadataBase` set in root layout to `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` (fixes OG/Twitter image URLs)
- `.npmrc` with `legacy-peer-deps=true` committed (required due to `@stripe/react-stripe-js` peer dep conflict)
- Supabase Auth → Site URL + Redirect URLs updated to production domain (both `https://venuecharm.vercel.app/**` and `http://localhost:3000/**`)
- **Two** Stripe webhook destinations on production: "Your account" scope (`payment_intent.amount_capturable_updated`, `transfer.created`, `charge.refunded`) and "Connected accounts" scope (`account.updated`, auto-syncs host onboarding). Their two signing secrets are stored as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` + `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET_CONNECT`; the handler verifies the payload against each secret in turn.
- Stripe Connect uses Account Links (not OAuth) — no redirect URI registration needed in Stripe Dashboard
- `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` `setAll` wrapped in try/catch — silences the "Cookies can only be modified in a Server Action or Route Handler" error thrown when Supabase tries to refresh the session during RSC rendering (middleware handles the real refresh)

---

### In-app Messaging (Supabase Realtime) · [#56](https://github.com/Abdalrahman-Muhtaseb/venuecharm/issues/56)
- **Migration `013_messaging_rls.sql`** ✅ applied 2026-06-15 — `conversations`/`messages` had RLS enabled in 001 but **no policies** (all access denied). Adds participant-scoped SELECT/INSERT on both, a read-receipt UPDATE policy on `messages`, indexes, and registers `messages` with the `supabase_realtime` publication (idempotent catalog check).
- `src/actions/messages.ts` — `startVenueConversation` (renter pre-booking inquiry), `startBookingConversation` (either party, tied to a booking), `sendMessage` (returns the inserted row for optimistic append), `markConversationRead`. Find-or-create dedupes threads by `renter_id+host_id+booking_id` (or `+venue_id` with null booking).
- `/messages` — unified inbox shared by hosts and renters (PublicNavbar layout like `/bookings`); conversation rows with other-party initials, venue title, last-message preview, unread badge. Uses `createAdminClient()` for the cross-user name/venue lookups (RLS-safe, server-only).
- `/messages/[id]` — thread page; `MessageThread` client component subscribes to Realtime `postgres_changes` INSERT filtered by `conversation_id`, dedupes by message id, Enter-to-send (Shift+Enter newline), marks inbound read on mount + on each incoming message.
- Entry points: "Contact host" on `/venues/[id]` (logged-in non-owner), "Message host" on `/bookings/[id]`, "Message guest" on `/host/bookings/[id]` — all via `StartConversationButton` (useTransition + NEXT_REDIRECT re-throw).
- Live unread badge in **PublicNavbar** (MessageCircle icon) and **HostSidebar** (Messages link) via the shared `useUnreadMessages()` hook (`src/hooks/`), which counts inbound unread and re-counts on any Realtime `messages` change.
- `/messages` added to `middleware.ts` auth protection; bilingual `messages` namespace added to `i18n.ts`.

### RFP Smart Matching · [#11](https://github.com/Abdalrahman-Muhtaseb/venuecharm/issues/11)
- **Migration `014_rfp.sql`** ✅ applied 2026-06-15 — adds an `amenities` wishlist column to `rfps`, **enables RLS** on `rfps`/`rfp_matches` (they had RLS disabled entirely since 001 — fully exposed), owner-scoped SELECT/INSERT/DELETE policies, and `ON DELETE CASCADE` from `rfp_matches` to `rfps`.
- `src/lib/rfp-matching.ts` — pure, unit-testable scoring. **Rebalanced in session 10 to five weighted axes** summing to 100: **capacity (25)**, **price (25)**, **amenities (15)**, **location (20)** (PostGIS distance from the RFP's geocoded city; full ≤10 km, zero ≥80 km), **event-type (15)** (venue advertises the requested type). Unconstrained dimensions (no location / event type OTHER / no amenities) award full marks so they don't skew the ranking. `estimatedCost()`, `matchedAmenities()`, `scoreVenue()`, `rankVenues()`.
- `src/actions/rfp.ts` — `createRfp` (insert request → score every ACTIVE venue → persist top 20 to `rfp_matches` → redirect to results), `deleteRfp`.
- `/rfp` — renter's request list (PublicNavbar layout) with per-request match counts + "New request". `/rfp/new` — `RfpForm` (event type, date, guests, budget, AmenitiesPicker, description) with a `useFormStatus` pending button. `/rfp/[id]` — request summary + venues ranked by score, each with a colored `%` badge and "why it matched" pills (fits capacity / within budget / X-of-Y amenities), linking to the venue in a new tab.
- `src/types/rfp.ts` — `eventTypes` + `createRfpSchema` (zod). `DeleteRfpButton` client component.
- `/rfp` added to `middleware.ts` auth protection; bilingual `rfp` namespace in `i18n.ts`; "Smart matching" entry in the navbar hamburger for renters.

### Google Calendar Integration (Host) · [#58](https://github.com/Abdalrahman-Muhtaseb/venuecharm/issues/58)
- **Migration `015_host_calendar.sql`** ✅ applied 2026-06-17 — creates `host_calendar_connections` table (one row per host: `host_id`, `provider`, `refresh_token`, `calendar_id`, `sync_enabled`, `last_synced_at`). RLS **enabled with no policies** — all access via service-role admin client only (the refresh token is a secret). Adds `google_event_id TEXT` column to `bookings`.
- `src/lib/google-calendar.ts` — `isGoogleCalendarConfigured()` guard, `getAuthUrl()` (offline access + consent prompt → refresh token), `exchangeCodeForRefreshToken()`, `createEvent()`, `deleteEvent()` via `googleapis` v173.
- `src/lib/calendar-sync.ts` — `syncConfirmedBooking(bookingId)` / `removeBookingEvent(bookingId)`, each fully wrapped in try/catch so a Calendar outage never blocks the booking flow. Reads the OAuth token via `createAdminClient()`.
- `src/actions/google-calendar.ts` — `startCalendarConnect()` (returns OAuth URL), `disconnectCalendar()` (deletes row from `host_calendar_connections`).
- `GET /api/google/calendar/callback` — validates `state` vs `auth.uid()`, calls `exchangeCodeForRefreshToken`, upserts into `host_calendar_connections`, redirects to `/host/calendar?calendar=connected|error|noToken`.
- Wired into `src/actions/bookings.ts`: `acceptBooking` → `syncConfirmedBooking`, `declineBooking` / `cancelOwnBooking` → `removeBookingEvent` (all fire-and-forget).
- `HostCalendarConnectCard` on `/host/calendar` — 3-state card (not configured / connected / not connected), useTransition + toast, "Connect" → OAuth redirect, "Disconnect" → server action + router.refresh.
- Bilingual `calendarSync` namespace in `i18n.ts` (he/en). Three new env vars: `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI`.
- Degrades gracefully — with no credentials, the card shows "not configured" and the app runs normally.

### CI/CD (GitHub Actions) · [#55](https://github.com/Abdalrahman-Muhtaseb/venuecharm/issues/55)
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — runs on every push/PR to `main`: `npm ci` → `npm run lint` → `npx tsc --noEmit` → `npm run build` (Node 20, npm cache, concurrency cancel-in-progress).
- Build step uses placeholder Supabase env with `secrets.*` fallback, so CI is green without secrets (all pages are dynamic — nothing fetches at build time). Real `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` + `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` repo secrets added for building against the real project.
- `.eslintrc.json` added (`next/core-web-vitals`) — none existed, so `next lint` would have prompted interactively and hung CI. Fixed 4 pre-existing `react/no-unescaped-entities` lint errors so the lint gate passes.

### UX Overhaul · Image Performance · Venue Types · Location Matching (session 10)
Branch `fix/ux-batch-and-image-perf` (merged to `main`). **Migrations 016, 017, 018 applied 2026-06-24.**
- **Bug fixes** — post-login redirect to prior page / homepage (`isSafeRedirectPath`, `?redirect=` through middleware + OAuth callback); self-service **Become a host** via `becomeHost()` (the old link 404'd because the `(host)` route group doesn't add a `/host` prefix — real path is `/listings/new`).
- **Navbar / layout** — single "Log in" button, footer pages + language toggle in the hamburger, instant theme toggle, full-width header/footer.
- **Search / filters** — amenity filter is now a wrapping **chip grid** (shared `FilterPanel`); dragging the map updates the navbar "Where" field to **"Map area"** via a `venuecharm:mapsearch` window event.
- **Venue UX** — venue-card photos are **swipeable on touch** (single-image swap kept for perf + swipe-vs-tap guard); **location map** on the detail page (`VenueLocationMap` + `get_venue_coordinates` RPC, migration 016, with a geocode fallback); removed the "Back to search" link; per-tab counts on `/bookings`; **event-type badges** on the detail page.
- **Image performance (#6)** — `src/lib/image.ts` `BLUR_DATA_URL` + `placeholder="blur"` on card/gallery/homepage images; `seeds/migrate-images-to-cloudinary.ts` (`npm run migrate:images`) dedupes & moves the Unsplash seed photos into Cloudinary with `f_auto,q_auto`. Seed photos are external Unsplash hotlinks **by design** until migrated.
- **Venue event types (#7)** — multi-select chip picker (`EventTypesPicker`) on the create/edit forms, stored in `venues.event_types` (migration 017); shared vocabulary in `src/types/event-types.ts`.
- **Location-aware RFP matching (#18)** — optional geocoded city on the RFP (migration 018: `rfps.city/latitude/longitude`); matching adds location + event-type dimensions.

---

### Auth Modal · Onboarding · Smart-Match Search · Chat App · Admin Analytics (session 11)
All uncommitted on `main` as of 2026-06-25. **No new migrations** — every feature works against the existing schema.

- **Auth as a modal** — login/signup is now a global modal (`AuthModalProvider` in the root layout + `AuthModal`), opened from the navbar "Log in" / "Become a host". The `/login` & `/register` pages are kept as fallbacks (middleware redirects, email-verify links, direct URLs). Role selection removed from signup — **everyone starts RENTER**; `signUpWithGoogle` collapsed to `signInWithGoogle`. Modal closes reliably on success via `isRedirectError` (checks `digest`, not just `message`) + a route-change effect in the provider.
- **Onboarding** — new signups land on a skippable **`/onboarding` "About me"** step (`OnboardingForm` + `src/actions/onboarding.ts`, `venuecharm-onboarded` cookie so it doesn't re-nag). `signIn`/OAuth callback route incomplete-profile users there. **Become a host** now routes to a **`/host/onboarding` checklist** (profile → Stripe required → first listing gated on `stripe_charges_enabled`).
- **Best-match search (#68)** — "Best match" sort on `/venues` reuses `rankVenues()`; match-% badge on `VenueCard`. `rfp-matching.ts` capacity/price dimensions now award full marks when unconstrained.
- **Event type in search (#7 follow-up)** — a "Why" segment in the search pill + an Event-type filter in `FilterPanel`; `event_type` URL param filtered on the venues page and the bounds API (via a secondary `event_types` lookup, no RPC change).
- **Filter modal overhaul** — staged (applies only on "Show results"), wider, lighter overlay (`bg-black/40`), **dynamic max price** (highest active-venue hourly price, not hardcoded), Sort beside Event type. **Map-drag now keeps filters** (bounds search carries + applies capacity/price/sort/amenities/event_type).
- **Search form compact mode** — the navbar (results-page) search pill is shorter with labels hidden; collapsed search button resized so it isn't clipped. DatePanel flex pills moved to the bottom + fixed the ±N-day selection not showing on the calendar.
- **Messages → chat app** — two-pane layout (conversation list left, thread right) in `messages/layout.tsx` (footer removed, full-height); `ConversationList` is **realtime** (live last message, unread bump-to-top, reset on open) and **sorted by recency**; `MessageThread` has avatars, day separators, message grouping, an **emoji picker**, **optimistic send** (instant bubble + sending/sent status), and the page-scroll-to-bottom bug is fixed (scrolls the container, not the window).
- **Landing page** — auto-rotating hero collage (`HeroCollage`), 5th feature card ("Smart matching"), "View more" button that resolves nearby/Tel-Aviv like an empty search, and the **bookings-completed stat fixed to the overall total** (was RLS-scoped per-user) + rounded for social proof (`approxCount`).
- **Venue detail** — Share button (`ShareVenueButton`, Web Share + clipboard), "About the host" section, 2-month availability calendar, cancellation policy moved to the bottom, and the map's "ctrl+scroll" overlay removed (`gestureHandling: 'greedy'`).
- **Admin analytics** — new **Analytics tab** on `/admin/dev`: revenue/GMV-over-time + registrations bar charts (`MonthlyBarChart`, dependency-free) and top-venues-by-bookings, backed by pure helpers in `src/lib/admin-analytics.ts`.

---

### UX Batch · Time-slot Availability · Turnaround Buffer (session 12)
All on `main` (about to be committed). **Migrations 019, 020, 021 applied 2026-06-27.**

**17-item UX batch**
- **Auth**: Google brand icon on all "Continue with Google" buttons (`GoogleIcon`); reusable themed `BrandBackground` (purple gradient + blobs) behind the auth modal, onboarding, hero. **Auth-modal "not appearing" regression fixed** — `relative` on a `fixed` `DialogContent` was dropped by tailwind-merge (see MEMORY).
- **Navbar**: bordered icon buttons; menu items now carry icons; **host↔guest mode switch** — hosts/admins see traveler links + "Switch to hosting", host sidebar + admin get an explicit exit; **per-navigation auth flicker fixed** via a root-layout `UserProvider` (server-seeded `useCurrentUser`, no per-mount refetch).
- **Search**: "Nearby" now fills the Where field instantly (cached geolocation); **date filtering implemented** ("any free day in range" — was collected but ignored) in `src/lib/availability-filter.ts`, wired into the venues page + bounds API; one-click **"Best match"** pill in the results toolbar; bigger/crisper match badge.
- **Venue detail**: reordered (photos → about → amenities → availability → reviews → location → host) with reviews/location/host **full-width**; **interactive sticky booking widget** (date + hour/day + live price → checkout); **"Things to know"** (house rules + cancellation, each with a Learn-more modal, rules line-by-line).
- **Listing form**: **house rules** field (migration 019 `venues.rules`); explicit **reservation-system** toggle (per hour / per day / both).
- **Content/data**: refreshed `adminSeedVenues` (11 venues, photos, catalog amenity keys, event types, rules, mixed modes); **Help Center** at `/help` + `/help/[slug]` (booking/hosting/payments/trust-safety/faq) linked from footer + menu.
- **Messaging**: **lazy conversation creation** — "Contact host" opens a `/messages/new` composer; the conversation row + first message are created together via `sendFirstMessage`, so an accidental click no longer leaves an empty thread in both inboxes. Contact-host button moved into the host section.

**Map / venue-detail fixes**
- Map markers show price for day-only venues (`price_per_hour ?? price_per_day`); marker popup link opens in a new tab; hovering a marker raises it above overlapping neighbours; venue-detail map taller + higher zoom (fullscreen control later removed per request).
- Availability month calendar: strikethrough on unavailable days (the v8 `day_disabled` class was a no-op under v9 — use `disabled`), wider/no-border, month-nav arrows restored (`relative` on `months`), legend removed.

**Time-slot (week-view) availability** · migration 020
- `venues.opening_time`/`closing_time` + new `availability_blocks` table (per-hour host blocks; public read, host-manage RLS).
- `src/lib/availability-slots.ts` (hourly slots, week helpers, slot-state, taken-ranges, buffer expansion); reusable `WeekAvailabilityGrid` (host: click slots / day headers to block-free; renter: click to select a start→checkout range or a whole day).
- **Month/Week toggle** on both the renter venue page (`AvailabilitySection`) and the host dashboard (`HostAvailabilityManager`, `/host/calendar`).
- **Booking flow is now time-slot aware** — the widget no longer blocks a whole day after one partial booking; Start/End dropdowns filter against bookings + host blocks + operating hours; the EXCLUDE constraint stays the safety net. Whole-day grid selection resolves to the **day rate** when one exists (not hours × hourly).

**Turnaround buffer** · migration 021
- `venues.buffer_minutes` + a "Turnaround between bookings" selector in the listing form. Enforced in `requestBooking` (admin-client clash check, since RLS hides other renters' bookings) and reflected in availability (bookings padded by the buffer in the renter grid + widget dropdowns).

**Final navbar tweaks**
- Header: removed theme + chat buttons, added a **placeholder notification bell** (system not built yet); menu trimmed (removed Find venues / How it works / Pricing, kept Help center); host/admin exit links relabeled "Exit hosting" / kept "Back to site" and now redirect to `/`.

### Notification System · Auth Overhaul · Maps Fixes · Custom Domain + SEO (session 13)
On `feat/notifications`. **Migration 022 applied.** No other migrations.

**Notification system** · [#73](https://github.com/Abdalrahman-Muhtaseb/venuecharm/issues/73) — replaces the placeholder navbar bell with a real Realtime feed (modeled on the messaging pattern).
- **Migration `022_notifications.sql`** — `notifications` table (`user_id, type, data jsonb, link, is_read, created_at`), owner-scoped RLS (read/update/delete; **no INSERT policy** — cross-user rows are written only via the service-role admin client), registered with the `supabase_realtime` publication.
- `src/lib/notifications.ts` — `notify()` server helper (admin client, fire-and-forget like the email senders). `src/lib/notification-copy.ts` — shared types + bilingual (he/en) title/body renderer so text matches the **viewer's** locale, not the actor's.
- Wired into 6 lifecycle events next to the email sends: booking requested→host, accepted→renter, declined→renter, cancelled→host (`bookings.ts`), new message→other party (`messages.ts`), new review→host (`reviews.ts`).
- `useNotifications()` (feed) + `useUnreadNotifications()` (count) hooks — Realtime, unique channel names so the bell + panel can co-mount. `NotificationBell` (navbar dropdown, unread badge, mark-read, deep-links) replaces the placeholder; `NotificationsPanel` + `/notifications` page (in `middleware.ts`); host sidebar gets a Notifications link with badge. `src/actions/notifications.ts` — `markAllNotificationsRead`, `markNotificationRead`.

**Auth overhaul** (login/signup pages + modal) — addresses 7 reported issues.
- **Login is now client-side** (browser Supabase client) so `onAuthStateChange` fires and the navbar + modal update **instantly** — fixes the "authenticated in the background but UI stale until refresh" bug. `UserProvider` also adopts a refreshed `initialUser`.
- **Register rewritten** — first/last name, **confirm password**, **password show/hide eye** (`PasswordInput`), inline per-field red errors, and an email-verification **"check your inbox"** state. `signUp` returns typed error codes (no throws) incl. `rate_limit` / `email_send` so Supabase mailer failures aren't mislabeled as "invalid email".
- Logged-out **"Become a host" → login modal** (may already have a renter account). **Google-only accounts** get a friendly "use Continue with Google" message (`getAuthMethod`). **hCaptcha** scaffolded (`HCaptchaWidget`, no-op without `NEXT_PUBLIC_HCAPTCHA_SITE_KEY`). Callback handles both `?code=` and `?token_hash=` verification links + expired-link errors. New shared `LoginForm`/`RegisterForm` used by both the modal and the `/login`+`/register` pages.

**Google Maps console-warning fixes** — added `&loading=async` to all four Maps JS loaders; removed the inline `styles` from the two maps that also set `mapId` (ignored when a `mapId` is present).

**Custom domain `venuecharm.com` + SEO** — domain purchased via Vercel. Code is fully env-driven (no hardcoded URLs), so production is driven by Vercel env. Added `src/app/robots.ts` + `src/app/sitemap.ts` (static + Help articles + all ACTIVE venues, all via `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`). Synced `.env.example` (added `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET_CONNECT`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_HCAPTCHA_SITE_KEY`). Dashboard config (Supabase URLs, Stripe webhooks, Google OAuth/Maps, Resend domain + Supabase SMTP) done outside the repo.

`feat/notifications` merged to `main` via [PR #76](https://github.com/Abdalrahman-Muhtaseb/venuecharm/pull/76) on 2026-06-28.

---

### Profile, Auth & Email Batch (session 14) · merged via [PR #85](https://github.com/Abdalrahman-Muhtaseb/venuecharm/pull/85)
On `feat/profile-auth-emails`, merged to `main` 2026-06-29. Summarized from commit history (this session's `/wrap` wasn't run when the branch landed):
- **Account/profile** — Google sign-in data completion flow, Israeli phone number validation, bio + birthday fields added to profile.
- **Privacy controls** — per-field visibility toggles (e.g. `users.visibility.reviews` driving reviewer anonymization); email change removed from self-service profile editing.
- **Auth** — emailed password-reset flow (Supabase `resetPasswordForEmail`) and a Google-first auth form layout. This closes the "Forgot-password flow" item that was previously listed as not built.
- **Email** — branded bilingual (he/en) auth email templates; a happy-birthday cron job added alongside the existing booking-lifecycle emails.
- **UI polish** — search dropdown fix, role-aware CTA button, branded scrollbar, footer cleanup.

### Auto-cancel Overdue Bookings · Reviews Grid Pagination · Host Portal Overhaul · SVG Favicon (session 15)
On `feat/auto-cancel-pending-and-reviews-grid`, branched fresh off `origin/main` (after discarding a redo caused by a stale local `main` that was 22 commits behind — see [[stale-branch-before-session-start]] in memory).

**Bug fix — overdue PENDING bookings now auto-cancel** · `src/lib/booking-expiry.ts`, `src/app/api/cron/expire-bookings/route.ts`
- A PENDING booking the host never responds to (request older than 7 days, or whose `start_at` has already passed) is auto-rejected: status flips to `REJECTED` via a race-safe atomic claim (`.update({status:'REJECTED'}).eq('status','PENDING')` + checking the returned row count, so a concurrent host accept/decline can't double-process the same row), the held Stripe PaymentIntent is cancelled (manual-capture authorization — nothing was captured, so no refund math needed), and the renter gets the existing decline email + notification.
- `GET /api/cron/expire-bookings` — `CRON_SECRET` Bearer-token guarded (same pattern as `/api/cron/birthday`), scheduled **daily** in `vercel.json` (`0 5 * * *`) alongside the existing birthday cron. Originally scheduled hourly, but the project is staying on Vercel's Hobby plan (which caps cron frequency at once/day), so it was switched to daily — the 7-day host-response window comfortably absorbs the coarser granularity. Closed as [#88](https://github.com/Abdalrahman-Muhtaseb/venuecharm/issues/88).

**Reviews — grid + "Show more" pagination** · `src/lib/reviews-format.ts`, `src/actions/reviews.ts`, `src/components/venue/ReviewList.tsx`
- Venue detail reviews render as a responsive grid (1/2/3 cols depending on viewport) instead of one stacked list. First 6 reviews load with the page; a "Show more" button calls the new `loadVenueReviews(venueId, offset, limit)` server action (capped at 24/request, `useTransition`, dedupes by id). Avg rating/count are computed from a separate full-table query (`ratingsRes` on the venue page) so they stay accurate beyond the first loaded page. Reviewer anonymization (`visibility.reviews`) is factored into a shared `toReviewItem()` mapper used by both the initial server-rendered page and client-side pagination, so the two code paths can't drift.

**Host portal overhaul — routes moved under `/host/**`, professionalized dashboard**
- All host-only pages now live under `(host)/host/(panel)/*` (dashboard, listings, bookings, calendar, payouts, onboarding) sharing one scrollable, padded wrapper layout. `/host/dashboard` replaces `/dashboard`; `/host/listings` replaces `/listings` (old URLs 307-redirect via `next.config.mjs` `redirects()` for bookmarks/old links; `middleware.ts` and `robots.ts` simplified since the existing `/host` entries already covered the moved routes).
- Messages and notifications got **host-shell copies** instead of being moved: `/host/messages`, `/host/messages/[id]`, `/host/notifications` reuse the existing components/data loaders — `ConversationList`/`MessageThread` gained an optional `basePath` prop, and the query logic shared with `/messages` was extracted into `src/lib/messages-data.ts` (`loadConversationSummaries`, `loadThread`). Renters keep `/messages`/`/notifications` unchanged; `src/actions/messages.ts` gained a `threadLink(conversationId, hostSide)` helper so redirects/notification links resolve to the right shell.
- `HostSidebar` rewritten: desktop is a fixed, full-height column (`<aside class="hidden h-full w-60 shrink-0 ...">`) that never scrolls independently — only the panel content scrolls; mobile gets a `Sheet`-based hamburger drawer (`HostMobileNav`) matching the main site's nav pattern. "Exit hosting" moved to the **bottom** of the sidebar, above the theme toggle (previously at the top).
- `/host/dashboard` redesigned end to end: personalized greeting, primary action buttons (Add listing / Availability), Stripe onboarding banner (unchanged condition) and a first-run empty state, 4 KPI cards (active listings, pending requests — highlighted, upcoming bookings, total revenue), 3 secondary stat tiles (month revenue, completed stays, avg rating), a "Needs your attention" section (up to 5 PENDING bookings with inline accept/decline), and an "Upcoming bookings" section (up to 5 CONFIRMED future bookings).
- Every `revalidatePath`/redirect target across `src/actions/venues.ts`, `src/actions/availability.ts`, `src/actions/stripe-connect.ts`, plus navbar/footer/booking-widget links, updated to the new `/host/*` paths.

**Favicon** · `src/app/icon.svg`
- New SVG icon route using the `logo/logo.svg` icon mark (no wordmark), recolored with the same purple gradient as `LogoFull` (`#3b0764 → #7e22ce → #a855f7`, `gradientUnits="userSpaceOnUse"`). Next.js auto-serves it alongside the existing `icon.png`/`apple-icon.png`; modern browsers prefer the SVG. The PNG fallbacks (`icon.png`, `apple-icon.png`, OG/Twitter images) were left as-is — regenerating them from the new source would need a rasterizer (`sharp` isn't installed in this environment).

**Docs** — `logo/file.svg` was renamed by the user to `logo/logo-name-horizantal.svg`; updated all references in `CLAUDE.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `PROGRESS.md`.

**Validation** — `npx tsc --noEmit` clean, `npx next lint --file <changed files>` clean, full `npx next build` with placeholder env vars confirmed all new/moved routes compile (`/host/dashboard`, `/host/listings`, `/host/messages(/[id])`, `/host/notifications`, `/icon.svg`, etc.) and the old `/dashboard`/`/listings` routes are gone (now redirects).

### Host Portal UX Overhaul · Listing Wizards · Payouts Chart · Per-venue Calendar (session 16)
On `feat/host-portal-ux-overhaul`, branched off `feat/auto-cancel-pending-and-reviews-grid` (PR #90 already merged).

**HostPanelHeaderBar + HostSidebar redesign**
- New `HostPanelHeaderBar` component: sticky per-page header rendered in the `(panel)` layout; pathname lookup maps each route to a title + icon; notification bell + theme toggle on the right; "Add listing" action appears only on `/host/listings`.
- `HostSidebar` bottom section replaced with `HostProfileLink` — host avatar, full name, and a sign-out button. Removed "Settings" and "Notifications" from the nav list (notifications accessible via the bell).
- Shared `HostHeaderBar` base component (accepts a pre-rendered `ReactNode` icon, not a `ComponentType`, to avoid server/client serialization errors).

**Listings page redesign** · `src/app/(host)/host/(panel)/listings/page.tsx`
- Table view with **sortable column headers** (URL `?sort=` params, `nextSortFor()` toggle): name, city, capacity, price, status.
- **Card view** with `HostListingCard` (photo, title, city, capacity, event types, status badge, pricing side-by-side, icon-only actions).
- `ViewSwitcher` (`storageKey`, `localStorage`-based toggle, no URL param) with a `cardOnlyControl` slot for `ListingsSortSelect` (card view only).
- `ListingsFilterBar` — debounced search, URL `?q=` param.
- Request-approval button replaces the delete button for DRAFT listings (icon-only Send icon).
- **Add listing** button moved from panel header into the toolbar (left of the search bar), so the header is decluttered.

**New listing form → 6-step wizard** · `src/components/venue/venue-creation-wizard.tsx`
- Steps: Basics → Event types → Location → Capacity & amenities → Pricing & schedule → Photos & rules.
- Each step has a full-bleed gradient card header (unique colour per step), step indicator pills + progress bar, "Back / Continue" navigation, success screen with confetti-free confirmation card.
- **WeekdayPicker** in step 5 (Pricing): selects which days the venue is open. Writes `default_available_days` to the DB and pre-seeds the `availability` table for the next 90 days (`applyWeekdayAvailability()`). Migration 027 (`venues.default_available_days INT[] DEFAULT '{0,1,2,3,4,5,6}'`).
- Submission via `FormData` passed to the existing `createVenue` server action (no API route needed).

**Edit listing form → 6-step wizard** · `src/components/venue/venue-edit-wizard.tsx`
- Same 6-step layout, pre-populated from `venue` prop; photos tab shows existing photos with per-photo remove plus new uploads merged on save.
- **WeekdayPicker** in step 5 pre-selected from `venue.default_available_days`; saving re-seeds 90 days.
- **Map pin fix**: `VenueMapPicker` passes `initialLatitude`/`initialLongitude` from `get_venue_coordinates` RPC (array-safe: `coordRows[0]`). Root cause of pin-not-showing was `AdvancedMarkerElement` silently failing without a registered Google Cloud Map ID — fixed by removing `libraries=marker` from the script URL and switching to the legacy `google.maps.Marker` (no Map ID required). Also fixed geocoder: client-side geocoding used the NEXT_PUBLIC key which has browser referrer restrictions → 403; replaced with a `reverseGeocode` server action (`src/actions/geocode.ts`) that uses the unrestricted `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`. Geocoder was also using the callback API (silently ignored under `loading=async`) — fixed to Promise-based `.geocode().then().catch()`.
- `onLocationResolved` callback: when the user drops a pin the wizard re-enables the "Continue" button by updating wizard state (address/city/lat/lng), which was previously stuck disabled because the geocoder only wrote to DOM inputs, not React state.

**Bookings page redesign** · `src/app/(host)/host/(panel)/bookings/page.tsx`
- 4 tabs: **All / Pending / Upcoming / Past** (URL `?tab=` param). Pending tab badge is highlighted.
- Server-side pagination: 12 bookings per page, `?page=N` param.
- `BookingsSearchBar` — debounced search `?q=` against venue title and renter name (renter data fetched via `createAdminClient()` to bypass RLS).
- `HostBookingCard` — photo, venue, renter name, dates, amount, status badge, link to detail.

**Booking detail page redesign** · `src/app/(host)/host/(panel)/bookings/[id]/page.tsx`
- **Row 1** (3 equal-height columns): Venue details (photo, title, cancellation policy, pricing per hour/day) | Event details (dates, duration, all-day flag) | Pricing (subtotal, fee, net earnings, refund if cancelled).
- **Row 2**: Renter info 2/3 (avatar, name, member-since, bio, review if COMPLETED) | Actions or existing review 1/3.
- Renter data fetched via `createAdminClient()` to bypass `users` RLS.
- Net earnings computed from `payments.host_payout_amount`.

**Payouts page redesign** · `src/app/(host)/host/(panel)/payouts/page.tsx`
- **5 KPI cards** (`PayoutsKpiCards`): Gross revenue (total captured), Platform fee (15%), Your earnings (net), Pending (held, not yet captured), Refunded. Each card has an info `<Tooltip>` beside the title explaining the metric.
- **Recharts AreaChart** (`PayoutsChart`): date-range picker (start/end), period shortcuts (1W/1M/3M/6M/1Y), **Earnings / Gross toggle**. Daily buckets from the `payments` table with correct gross = `amount + platform_fee_amount`.
- Payout history table: venue name, date, gross, your cut, status badge.

**Dashboard redesign + live updates** · `src/app/(host)/host/(panel)/dashboard/page.tsx`
- 4 shortcut cards (Add listing, Manage calendar, View payouts, Messages + live unread badge).
- 5 KPI tiles: Active listings, Pending requests (highlighted), Upcoming bookings, Total revenue, Avg rating.
- Listings health strip (ACTIVE / PENDING / DRAFT counts).
- Secondary stats: This-month revenue, Completed bookings, Review count.
- **Needs your attention** (up to 5 PENDING bookings, inline accept/decline).
- **Upcoming bookings** (up to 5 CONFIRMED future bookings).
- **Recent reviews** column (right side, up to 5).
- `DashboardLive` — zero-UI client component: subscribes to Supabase Realtime on `bookings`/`messages`/`reviews`/`notifications` channels, calls `router.refresh()` with a 1 s debounce so KPIs update live without a page reload.
- `DashboardMessagesCard` — uses `useUnreadMessages()` directly (same hook as the sidebar) so the badge updates in real time matching the sidebar count. Fixed channel name collision by adding a random suffix in `useUnreadMessages`.
- `export const revalidate = 60` on the page so Next.js re-fetches KPIs on CDN every minute too.

**Calendar page redesign** · `src/app/(host)/host/(panel)/calendar/page.tsx`
- Two-step flow: when no `?venueId=` param, renders a venue-picker grid with `VenueSearchBar` (debounced). Selecting a venue adds `?venueId=` and switches to the calendar editor with a back link + venue name in the page header slot.
- `HostAvailabilityManager` gained `headerSlot`, `calendarConfigured`, `calendarConnected` props; Google Calendar button moved to the top-right of the section (beside the Month/Week toggle). Week grid wrapped in `max-h-[480px] overflow-y-auto`.
- `CalendarSyncDialog` — compact toolbar button opens a modal containing the full `HostCalendarConnectCard`.

**Profile page redesign** · `src/app/profile/page.tsx`, `src/components/profile/profile-form.tsx`
- Hero gradient banner (purple, matching brand) with avatar centered over it.
- Two-column layout on desktop: personal info left, account & security right.
- `ILPhoneInput` — "+972" prefix chip, numeric-only input.
- `BirthdayPicker` — three `<Select>` dropdowns (day / month / year), dd/mm/yyyy order, minimum age removed (18+ check dropped), displayed as Mon d, yyyy; birthday is always private (no visibility badge shown).

**Per-venue Google Calendar sync** · `src/lib/calendar-sync.ts`, `src/lib/google-calendar.ts`
- `resolveCalendarId(hostId, venueId, venueTitle)` — on first confirmed booking for a venue, creates a dedicated Google Calendar named after the venue via `createCalendar()`, persists the calendar ID to `venues.google_calendar_id` (migration 026), and returns it. Subsequent bookings for the same venue reuse the stored ID.
- OAuth scope changed from `calendar.events` → `calendar` (required for `calendars.insert`). Existing connected hosts must disconnect and reconnect.
- Migration 026: `venues.google_calendar_id TEXT`.

**Bug fixes**
- `charge.refunded` Stripe webhook now stores `stripe_refund_id: charge.refunds?.data?.[0]?.id` (was only storing `refund_amount`).
- Message `notify()` deduplicates: skips sending a notification if an unread notification of the same type already exists for that conversation+recipient.
- `useUnreadMessages` channel name gets a random suffix to prevent "cannot add postgres_changes callbacks after subscribe()" error when multiple components mount the hook simultaneously.

**Migrations applied** (in Supabase SQL Editor, confirmed by user)
- `026_venue_calendar.sql` — `venues.google_calendar_id TEXT`
- `027_venue_default_days.sql` — `venues.default_available_days INT[] DEFAULT '{0,1,2,3,4,5,6}'`

## Session 17 — Admin Panel Overhaul (2026-07-02)

_Branch: `feat/admin-panel`. Staged, not yet committed or merged._

### Admin panel complete rebuild

**New `(panel)` route group under `/admin`** — all admin pages now live in `src/app/(admin)/admin/(panel)/` with a shared panel layout (`AdminSidebar` shell + `AdminPanelHeaderBar`). The old flat layout (PublicNavbar + AdminSubNav + Footer) is gone.

**AdminSidebar** · `src/components/admin/AdminSidebar.tsx`  
- Replaces `AdminSubNav`. Desktop: fixed full-height column. Mobile: `AdminMobileNav` Sheet drawer.
- Nav links: Dashboard, Venues, Users, Bookings, Analytics, Amenities, Dev Tools.
- Bottom section: `LangToggle` → `ExitAdmin` → `AdminProfileLink` (name + role badge + sign-out).
- Receives `locale` from the (panel) layout via cookie read.

**AdminPanelHeaderBar** · `src/components/admin/AdminPanelHeaderBar.tsx`  
- Pathname→title+icon lookup: each admin route gets a title and Lucide icon.
- Right slot: notification bell + theme toggle.
- Used in the `(panel)` layout; shares the same base as `HostPanelHeaderBar`.

**Admin dashboard** · `src/app/(admin)/admin/(panel)/dashboard/page.tsx`
- 11 parallel `createAdminClient()` queries resolved with `Promise.all`.
- **KPI row** (4 cards): Total venues / Total users / Bookings this month / GMV this month; each shows a weekly trend ± badge (`weekRange(weeksAgo)` helper computes ISO date ranges).
- **Secondary KPI strip**: Platform revenue (GMV × 15%) / Active venues / PENDING_APPROVAL / Confirmed bookings.
- **Charts row** (5-col grid): `AdminRevenueChart` (3/5) + `AdminStatusDonut` (2/5).
- **Pending approvals + recent bookings** (5-col grid, 2/5 + 3/5).
- **Venue health** — 4 cards (ACTIVE / PENDING_APPROVAL / DRAFT / SUSPENDED) with colored progress bars, each links to `/admin/venues?status=KEY`.
- Quick navigation section removed (sidebar covers navigation).

**Admin bookings list** · `src/app/(admin)/admin/(panel)/bookings/page.tsx`
- Stat cards: Total / Pending / Confirmed / Completed / Cancelled / Rejected counts.
- Period filter: All time / This week / This month / This year (URL `?period=`).
- `AdminBookingsSearchBar` — debounced search against venue title / renter name.
- Sortable column headers (`SortableTableHead`) — status / date / amount; `?sort=&dir=`.
- Pagination: 20 per page.

**Admin booking detail** · `src/app/(admin)/admin/(panel)/bookings/[id]/page.tsx`
- Status timeline stepper (visual sequence: Requested → Confirmed → Completed; with Cancelled/Rejected variants).
- Three info cards: Venue (photo, title, city) | Booking (dates, duration, notes) | Renter (avatar, name, email, role).
- Financial receipt card: gross / platform fee / host payout / refund (if any) / Stripe PI id.
- `AdminCancelBookingButton` — now correctly gates on `PENDING_APPROVAL || CONFIRMED` (was incorrectly checking `PENDING`).

**Admin analytics** · `src/app/(admin)/admin/(panel)/analytics/page.tsx`
- 8 KPI cards: GMV / Platform revenue / Total bookings / Avg booking value / Active venues / New users (30d) / Reviews / Avg rating.
- `AdminRevenueChart` — 6M/12M + Revenue/Bookings mode toggle.
- `AdminStatusDonut` — booking status breakdown pie.
- `AdminUsersBarChart` — monthly registrations bar chart.
- Top venues by revenue table (`rankVenuesByBookings`, fixed to sort revenue-primary).

**Admin amenities** · `src/app/(admin)/admin/(panel)/amenities/page.tsx`
- Grouped by category display (replaces flat list).
- `AmenitiesImportDialog` — CSV drag-and-drop with 2-step flow (idle → preview); client-side CSV parse with valid/invalid row summary before importing.

**Admin dev tools** · `src/app/(admin)/admin/(panel)/tools/page.tsx`
- Demo Control Center: live DB counts (venues/users/bookings/messages), integrations table (Stripe/Resend/Google Maps/Cloudinary/hCaptcha) with env-pill status, `SeedDataPanel`, `DangerZonePanel` (AlertDialog confirmations, two severity levels).

**Recharts chart components**
- `AdminRevenueChart` — `AreaChart` with two datasets (GMV + booking count), Revenue/Bookings toggle, 6M/12M period toggle. Props: `{ gmv6M, gmv12M, cnt6M, cnt12M: MonthlyBucket[] }`.
- `AdminStatusDonut` — `PieChart` with `innerRadius={48}`, custom legend with count + %, center label. Props: `{ data: StatusBreakdown[] }`. Status colors: `PENDING_APPROVAL: '#f59e0b'`, `CONFIRMED: '#10b981'`, `COMPLETED: '#3b82f6'`, `CANCELLED: '#94a3b8'`, `REJECTED: '#ef4444'`.
- `AdminUsersBarChart` — `BarChart`, emerald bars, 6M/12M toggle.

**`src/lib/admin-analytics.ts` additions**
- `bookingStatusBreakdown(bookings)` → `StatusBreakdown[]` for the donut.
- `monthlyBookingCounts(bookings, n)` → `MonthlyBucket[]` for the area chart count series.
- `rankVenuesByBookings` sort fixed: `b.revenue - a.revenue || b.bookings - a.bookings` (revenue-primary).

### Language toggle in sidebars

**`LangToggle`** · `src/components/layout/LangToggle.tsx` (new shared client component)
- Segmented pill control: active locale gets `bg-background shadow-sm`, inactive gets muted text.
- Mechanism: `document.cookie = \`${localeCookieName}=...\`` + `router.refresh()` (identical to PublicNavbar).
- Added above `ExitHosting` in `HostSidebar` and above `ExitAdmin` in `AdminSidebar`.

### "House rules" → "Venue rules" rename

All UI text and translations changed:
- `src/lib/i18n.ts` — `'כללי הבית'` → `'כללי המקום'`; `'House rules'` → `'Venue rules'`
- `src/components/venue/ThingsToKnow.tsx` — section label + dialog title
- `src/components/venue/venue-creation-wizard.tsx` — step 6 subtitle
- `src/components/venue/venue-edit-wizard.tsx` — step 6 subtitle
- `src/components/venue/venue-creation-form.tsx` / `venue-edit-form.tsx` — comments
- `src/app/(admin)/admin/(panel)/[id]/page.tsx` — label `'חוקי הבית'` → `'כללי המקום'`
- `src/app/(host)/host/(panel)/listings/[id]/page.tsx` — same
- `src/lib/help-content.ts` — English hosting guide copy

### Bug fix: admin invite hash fallback (issue #95)

`HashSessionRedirect` · `src/components/auth/HashSessionRedirect.tsx`  
Added to `(auth)` layout as a workaround for Supabase invite links redirecting to `#access_token=` when the callback URL isn't in the Supabase allowlist. Processes the hash session client-side, calls `ensureUserProfile()`, and redirects to `/admin`. Permanent fix: add `/api/auth/callback` to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration → Redirect URLs.

_Session 17 (`feat/admin-panel`) merged to `main` (commit `b4e4d85`)._

---

## Session 18 — Comprehensive Automated Testing Suite (2026-07-02)

_First automated tests in the project — CI previously ran only lint + tsc + build. Merged to `main` via PRs #97–#104 and #106._

Full strategy documented in **`TESTING.md`** (phased plan, priority modules, CI gates, DoD). Stack: **Vitest** (unit + integration), **Playwright** (E2E), **@axe-core/playwright** (a11y). All tests live under `tests/`. Integration + E2E run against a dedicated **Supabase test project** (separate ref from prod), protected by a guard rail in `tests/helpers/setup.ts` that refuses any non-local Supabase URL unless `.env.test` sets `ALLOW_REAL_SUPABASE_IN_TESTS=true`.

**Unit (`tests/unit/`, ~84 tests, run in CI)** — `cancellation` (refund fractions + deadlines, all 3 policies, boundaries), `stripe`/`stripe-connect` (agorot rounding, 15%-on-top fee reconciliation), `utils` (open-redirect guard, `approxCount`), `i18n` (he/en key parity, currency/date formatters), `rfp-matching` (per-dimension scoring, `rankVenues`, no-constraint→full-marks), `ratings`, `availability-filter` (`buildDateRange`), `availability-slots`, `admin-analytics` (buckets, ranking, status breakdown).

**Integration (`tests/integration/`, against test DB)** — harness `tests/helpers/supabase.ts` (admin/anon clients, `createUser`/`signIn`, `makeVenue` via EWKT geography / `makeBooking` / `makePayment` factories, `cleanupAll`). Covers: double-booking EXCLUDE constraint; RLS boundaries (bookings scoping, venues ACTIVE-only, zero-policy `host_calendar_connections`, notifications owner-scope/no-INSERT); Stripe webhook handler (dual-secret verification + DB side-effects).

**E2E (`tests/e2e/`, Playwright/Chromium, against test DB)** — `playwright.config.ts` points `next dev` at the test project (injects `.env.test` into `webServer`, dedicated port 3100, never prod). Covers: public pages, i18n/RTL (cookie-driven he↔en), **authenticated booking journey** (real login → full-day date pick → checkout, PENDING booking verified in DB; `global-setup`/`global-teardown` seed host+venue+renter), a11y (axe, no critical/serious except known color-contrast), SEO (robots/sitemap), responsive. Serial (`workers: 1`) — one shared dev server + test DB.

**Migration fix** — `005_stripe_connect.sql` made idempotent (drop-loop before `CREATE OR REPLACE create_venue_listing`) so fresh applies don't hit `42725 function name is not unique` (PR #99).

**CI** — new `db-tests` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (`needs: verify`): rebuilds `.env.test` from `TEST_*` repo secrets, runs `vitest run tests/integration` + Playwright E2E (Chromium), uploads the report. Same-repo gate (fork PRs skip) + `concurrency: db-tests` (one shared test project). `verify` job (lint/tsc/unit/build) unchanged. Verified green end-to-end (PR #106).

Final tally: **~105 vitest tests** (unit + integration) + **20 Playwright E2E tests**, green locally and in CI.

**Performance (Lighthouse CI)** — added after the initial suite: `npm run test:perf` (`scripts/perf.mjs` + `lighthouserc.cjs`, `@lhci/cli`) builds a **production** bundle and runs Lighthouse on `/` + `/venues` via `next start` (:3200), reusing Playwright's Chromium (`CHROME_PATH`). Measured: **Perf 92, A11y 96–100, SEO 100, LCP ~1.7s, CLS <0.03**. Warn-only budgets; separate `.github/workflows/perf.yml` (manual + weekly), off the PR path.

### ⚠️ Known debt / config
- **WCAG AA color-contrast** violations on `/`, `/venues`, `/pricing` — the `color-contrast` axe rule is excluded from the a11y gate pending a design pass. Tracked in [#105](https://github.com/Abdalrahman-Muhtaseb/venuecharm/issues/105).
- **Load/stress testing** deferred (k6/Artillery) — free-tier Supabase/Vercel ceilings make numbers unrepresentative. Front-end performance IS covered (Lighthouse, above).

## 🔧 Immediate Next Steps (after Session 18)

1. **Fix issue #95 permanently** (carried over): add `https://venuecharm.com/api/auth/callback` + `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback` to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration → Redirect URLs.
2. **Color-contrast design pass** ([#105](https://github.com/Abdalrahman-Muhtaseb/venuecharm/issues/105)) → then remove `disableRules(['color-contrast'])` from `tests/e2e/a11y.spec.ts`.
3. **Submit sitemap** to Google Search Console (still pending).
4. Optional: bump `actions/checkout` + `actions/setup-node` to `@v5` (CI warns Node 20 actions deprecated).
